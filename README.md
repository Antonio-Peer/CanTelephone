# CanTelephone

This is a personal coding project undertake by me to explore and learn about using python to program scripts for shell.
The goal is to develop a script that would essentially function as a mailing service between my roomate and I, hosted on his home computer - Lilith. 

My goals in undertaking this project are as follows:

1. Learn about the shell and the idea of scripting.
1. Learn about using a high level language like python to interface with other enviroments.
In particular using python to control the shell towards an end. 
1. Exercise my somewhat weak foundation in creating, maintaining, and utilizing git/github. 
1. Ultimately be capable of sending/receiving messages to anyone who can shh into Lilith (including the owner themselves.)

## Problem Description/General Idea

The idea at its core is simple.
Currently I have the ability to ssh into Lilith.
I would like to be able to send and receive messages between myself and the owner of Lilith.
Additionally, I would like to be able to expand this ability to anyone who can also ssh into the machine.
In this way, this program will serve like a sort of can telephone where online individuals can converse and, if one of the party members are away or not logged in, can receive a message in a sort of mailbox.  

As a first step in accomplishing this, I will detail the features this program needs to accomplish in order to be functional.
These features/behaviors are described at a high level below.
